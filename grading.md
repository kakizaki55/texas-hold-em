# Texas Hold Em Grading Notes
_be sure to check the PR for specific code comments_
## General Comments
* Update your README -- details about what to include are [here](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/september-2021-foundations-i/blob/main/curriculum/labs/project-guidelines.md#documentation)
* Your tests are fantastic -- great job with those
* There is some refactoring that can be done on your game-utils using various array methods -- I put some examples on there but let me know if you want help -- your tests make it SUPER easy to refactor those functions which is awesome
* Overall your code is really modular, clean, well-tested, easy to read -- I'm super impressed
